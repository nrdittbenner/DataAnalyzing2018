# DataAnalyzing2018
When using the figure making program, import your data as an excel file.  Choose the columns you wish to import (or just delete unneeded ones in excel).  Copy and paste the variable name into the top of the program where is says "clearvars -except 'variable name'" and "table2array('variable name');".  
For the IV program, import your data as separate tables.  Highlight the data you wish to import, and then label it either ND96, CO2, or Na with respect to your solution.  If you use different solutions, let me know and I will tell you how to change the code to work for those.  the variable "g" in the work space will contain all the conductance values for the ranges -20 mV - 20 mV and -60 mV - 0 mV (it does a line fitting and gives you the slope which is the conductance).  You can open up "g" and get those values (the first column is -20-20 and the second is -60-0 with each row being a different solution).
